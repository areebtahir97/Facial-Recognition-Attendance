# Facial-Recognition-Attendance
Facial recognition attendance system using python.
This is a comprehensive project implementing facial recognition technology for automated attendance management.Developed with Python,OpenCV,and deep learning,this system captures and analyzes facial features to identify individuals and record attendance automatically in the form of CSV files.I have implemented the project on few subjects (Elon,Ronaldo,Messi and Leonardo) but you can automate it for a larger number of subjects by using the os module (basicaly importing another folder/file and using a for loop).
Note: Make sure you have the neccessary python packages installed.
